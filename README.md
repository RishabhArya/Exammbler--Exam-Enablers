# Exammbler-Exam-Enabler

In this project we made an online examination portal which  enable students to give their examinations from their respective homes.

We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design the frontend of the application. PHP is used to handle backend services from the application. Data is stored in MySQL database on XAMPP server.The students can register on the application using their Sap ids and their credentials will be stored in database. Then after logging in, they can see the guidelines for the tests and proceed to give their tests. Right click and copy and paste options have been disabled for security.
